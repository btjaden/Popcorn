There are two versions of each file:
      genome.all.pickle	  genome.all.pickle.v2
      model.all.pickle	  model.all.pickle.v2
      modeal.pickle	  model.pickle.v2

The two versions of each are identical in content. We provide two versions because files saved with one version of Python and its packages are not always compatible with other versions of Python and its packages.

The first version (without .v2) of each file was created using:
    Python 3.9.13
    sklearn 1.0.2
    numpy 1.21.5
    pandas 1.4.4

The second version (with .v2) of each file was created using:
    Python 3.9.13
    sklearn 1.5.2
    numpy 2.0.2
    pandas 2.2.3
